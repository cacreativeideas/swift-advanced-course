## Objectives


### Working with Enumerations, Structures, and Classes

* Use stored and lazy stored properties in instances of enumerations, structures, and classes in Swift
* Use computed properties with instances of enumerations, structures, and classes in Swift
* Use property and variable observers in Swift
* Define type properties for classes, structures, and enumerations in Swift
* Use instance methods with instance of classes, structures, and enumerations in Swift
* Define type methods for classes, structures, and enumerations in Swift
* Use subscripts with classes, structures, and enumerations in Swift
* Implement class inheritance with subclassing and overriding functionality in Swift


### Working with Types, Optionals, and Operators

* Implement type checking in Swift
* Implement DownCasting in Swift
* Implement type casting for Any and AnyObject in Swift
* Nest enumerations, structures, and classes in Swift
* Implement optional chaining in Swift
* Work with advanced operators in Swift
* Overload operators in Swift


### Advanced Function Definition

* Define functions using default and variadic parameters
* Define functions using variable and inout function parameters
* Define and pass around function types


### Extensions, Protocol, and Generics

* Introduce extensions and use them to add computed properties to classes, structures, and enumerations in Swift
* Introduce extensions and syntax, and use them to add initializers and methods to classes, structures, and enumerations in Swift
* Use extensions to add subscripts and nested types to classes, structures, and enumerations in Swift
* Use protocols as blueprints for functionality in Swift
* Introduce generics and use generics to write reusable functions in Swift
* Use generics to write reusable types in Swift


### Access Control and Importing Frameworks

* Describe general access level guidelines and describe how to implement custom access levels for specific entities in Swift
* Implement deinitialization for classes in Swift
* Describe automatic reference counting (ARC) and describe and resolve strong references cycles in Swift
* Import a framework and use one or more of its classes in a Swift program
